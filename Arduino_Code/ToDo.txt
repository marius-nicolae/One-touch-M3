ToDo:
1. In a side project test the CircularBuffer approach, where ISRS pushes events to a circular buffer and they are dispatched in the loop routine.
   The idea is sound but last time, for unknown reasons, the circular buffer missbehaved. For instance, for one pin interrupt there were more than 10
   events, with random values, pushed to tht circular bffer. Might be from the buffer implementation or something ISRs related.
   Create a test program on pc where lots of operations in the circular buffer will be simmulated and see the expected result

Done:
