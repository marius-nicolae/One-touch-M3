Small red led: 1.8V, 13.8mA. For 5V it needs an R = 1K; week light

Arduino input pins:
- 12V -> diode -> R1 100K ohm +-> R2 4.7K ohm -> GND
                             +-> C1 0.1 uF -> GND
- the signal is peeked-up from the point between R1 and the other R2 + C1 (shouldn't surpass 5V). However, due to internal protection diodes, with the resistors from above it should withstand to 100V

Used pins:
-  2 [IN]: righ turn switch
-  3 [IN]: left turn switch
-  4 [IN]: right bulb light (blink) signal
- 12 [IN]: left bulb light (blink) signal
-  5 [OUT]: right BCM signal (BCM stands for Body Control Module or Unitate de Control Habitablu in Romaninan)
-  6 [OUT]: left BCM signal  (BCM stands for Body Control Module or Unitate de Control Habitablu in Romaninan)

Caveats
- Arduino MiniPro has a bug in the bootloader which continuously restart the board if it was restarted by watchdog timer
- circular buffer with events pushed by ISRS gets corrupted after a while. To be investigated why ...
